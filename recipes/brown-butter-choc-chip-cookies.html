            <li>50 g granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg + 1 egg yolk, room temperature</li>

            <li>100 g dark chocolate, chopped</li>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown the butter over medium heat, stirring constantly until the butter foams and becomes a golden brown with a nutty aroma. Take this off the heat and leave to the side to cool down</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combined the cooled brown butter, brown and white sugar. Mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Add in the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract and mix together.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine flour, salt, and baking soda and whisk until combined.</li>
            <li>Slowly add and mix the dry ingredients into the wet until evenly combined.</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate until just combined. Do not over mix.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate the cookie dough for at least an hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180ÂºC and line the cookie pan with baking paper. Scoop and roll out cookie dough into even balls, spacing them evenly on the pan.</li>
            <li>Bake for 11 min or until golden brown. Let it cool before eating. Et voila! Fin!</li>
